                    Elden Ring is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective with
                    gameplay focusing on combat and exploration. It features elements similar to those
                    found in other games developed by FromSoftware, such as the Souls series, Bloodborne,
                    and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Combat in Elden Ring relies heavily on character-building
                    elements found in previous Souls games and related intellectual properties, such as
                    calculated and close-ranged melee-based combat with the use of skills, magic abilities,
                    as well as blocking and dodging mechanics.
